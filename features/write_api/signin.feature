Feature: Sign in

    Scenario: Show signed in user name
       Given I am logged in as "Max"
        when I go to "/_user"
        then I should get a "cache-control" header of "private, must-revalidate"
         and I should see the text "Signed in as Max"

    Scenario: Show signed in list of actions
       Given I am logged in as "Alex"
        when I go to "/_user"
        then I should see the text "Upload a CSV to the my_bucket bucket"
